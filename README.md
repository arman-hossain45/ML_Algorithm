# ML_Algorithm
 1.Basic Linear regression (How to work )

   ->Plot and using gradient decent _Based_Model(SGD_Regression)

   ->Polynomial regression also show here 

   ->multi feature linear regression 
   
 2.Decission tree (Basic how to work )

   ->simple synthetic data set use apply DT 

   ->plot decision tree 

   ->deep decision tree 

   ->Pruned Decision tree 

   ->confusion matrix,F1 score, Precission , Recall

   ->Plot confusion matrix

   ->ROC,Auc curve

  3.logistic regression 

   ->basic logistic regression

   ->Breast data set too apply Logistic regression then show the hole data set and 

   ->Basic metrics at default threshold 0.5

   ->Try different thresholds and see how precision and recall change

   ->Plot precision and recall vs threshold

   ->Two models with different regularization strengths


  4.Support Vector Machine
